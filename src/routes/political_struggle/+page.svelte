This organization was later upgraded to Muhajir Qaumi Movement (MQM) on March 18, 1984. Despite the fact that the venue of the party spread out from the university its main organizers remained the same as those during the university days working for APMSO. The main objective of the Muhajir Qaumi Movement was to urge the government to accept Muhajirs as a nationality of Pakistan like any other nationality of the country. In the center they demanded the right of representation and grant of quota in all educational institutions and jobs throughout the Sind province. They yearned for their quota in power echelon too. The movement played an important role to introduce the Mohajjirs in the power structure of Pakistan at high level. After he was severely criticized by the intellectuals and the general public, he was obliged to make his MQM onwards as Muttihida Qaumi Moverment.</p>
